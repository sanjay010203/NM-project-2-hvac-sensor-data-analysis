## Introduction

This project is part of my coursework for "Data Analysis in Mechanical Engineering." As a second-year Mechanical Engineering student, I wanted to apply what I've learned about data analysis tools and techniques to a real-world application. I chose HVAC systems because they play an important role in maintaining comfort and energy efficiency in buildings.

## Objective of the Project

The main goal of this project is to study data collected from various sensors used in HVAC systems. These sensors measure environmental and system-related factors such as:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* CO₂ concentration
* Airflow
* Occupancy
* Energy usage

By analyzing this data, I aim to discover patterns, trends, and relationships among these variables. This could help in understanding how different factors affect HVAC performance and how data analysis can be used to improve energy efficiency.

## Why This Topic?

HVAC systems are used everywhere — in homes, offices, factories, and even vehicles. Understanding how these systems perform with changing environmental conditions is useful for both engineers and building managers. This topic also connects mechanical engineering concepts with data analysis, making it a good choice for this course.

## What This Project Includes

* Cleaning and organizing raw sensor data
* Visualizing data to see trends clearly
* Performing correlation analysis between variables
* Discussing possible insights from the analysis
* Sharing my learning experience during the project

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This project helped me gain practical experience with real-world data and understand how data analysis can be applied in mechanical engineering fields. It also gave me insight into how sensor data from HVAC systems can be used for monitoring and optimization.
